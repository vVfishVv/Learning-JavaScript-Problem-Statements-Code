Javascript - Learning Process - Problem Statements - Code Solutions

I'll be going through the process of how I learned to use JavaScript for solving problems based off real world needs. 

I'll accompany each problem statement with a solution.

I'll also provide terms for items used in the solution as needed.

Consider this a ladder process. I'll go from the beginning to what I currently am able to do.

Cheers,
